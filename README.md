# dialect_variation
These files are available to anyone interested in geolinguistics and dialectology.
They include past and present linguistic frontiers in Brittany 'Limite linguistique de Basse-Bretagne', historical and archaeological boundaries, dialect areas and atlas grids.
By now, some of them are approximative, therefore, you are welcome to leave comments.
All those files are readable by QGIS. https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
After having downloaded a folder in this repository, just drag the .shp file to the main layer panel.
They are based on the WGS84 system.
You may have to change the global CRS (coordinate reference system) of your project.
